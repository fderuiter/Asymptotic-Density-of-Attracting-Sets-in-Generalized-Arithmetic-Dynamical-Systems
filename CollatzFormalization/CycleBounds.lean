# Cycle Bounds via Euler's Totient Theorem

This file formalizes **Lemma 1.2.2a**: for any coprime-constrained affine dynamical
system, the maximum length of any periodic cycle modulo `m` is strictly bounded by
Euler's totient function `φ(m)`.

## Strategy

We bypass `Nat` division and subtraction by working over a generic **commutative ring**
`R`.  This allows clean algebraic manipulations (including subtraction) during the proof
of the closed-form iterate.  We then specialise to `ZMod m` and apply Euler's theorem
(`ZMod.pow_totient`) to collapse the orbit.

## Main results

* `affine_iterate`               – the recursive definition of `n`-fold affine iteration.
* `iterate_affine_form_sum`      – closed-form expansion using a geometric finite sum.
* `affine_iterate_annihilated`   – multiplying by `(A - 1)` telescopes the sum.
* `affine_orbit_annihilator_mod` – after `φ(m)` steps, `(A - 1)` annihilates `f^L(x) - x` in `ZMod m`.

**Closed-form geometric expansion** (Lemma 1.2.2a, additive part).

Iterating the affine map `n` times decomposes as:
```
f^n(x) = Aⁿ · x + B · ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} Aⁱ
```
The proof proceeds by induction; the inductive step uses `geom_sum_succ` to
unfold `∑_{i=0}^{n} Aⁱ = A · ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} Aⁱ + 1`.

**Annihilator lemma** (eliminates the geometric sum via telescoping).

Multiplying the iterate by `(A - 1)` removes the finite sum entirely:
```
(A - 1) · f^n(x) = (A - 1) · Aⁿ · x + B · (Aⁿ - 1)
```
This uses `mul_geom_sum : (A - 1) · ∑ Aⁱ = Aⁿ - 1`.

### Section 2: Orbit bound via Euler's theorem in ZMod

section OrbitBounds

/--
**Annihilator modulo `m` after `φ(m)` steps** (Lemma 1.2.2a, main theorem).

This is a necessary algebraic step toward a full period bound.  It shows that
after `L = φ(m)` iterations the factor `(A - 1)` annihilates the orbit
difference in `ZMod m`:
```
(A - 1) · f^L(x) = (A - 1) · x   in ZMod m.
```
In other words, `(A - 1)` kills `f^L(x) - x` in the quotient ring.

**Note:** This is an *annihilator-style* statement, not a genuine period bound.
To conclude `f^L(x) = x` one would additionally need `IsUnit (A - 1)`, i.e.
that `(A - 1)` is invertible in `ZMod m`.  Without that assumption the result
cannot be strengthened to an orbit equality.

**Proof sketch:**
1. Use `affine_iterate_annihilated` to reduce to showing `A^L = 1` in `ZMod m`.
2. Lift `A` to a unit `u : (ZMod m)ˣ` via `IsUnit`.
3. Apply `ZMod.pow_totient u : u ^ φ(m) = 1` (Euler's theorem).
4. Close by `ring`.

### Section 3: Valuation Growth Rate (Lemma 1.2.2b)

We tighten the totient upper bound from Section 2 by providing an exact
**lower bound** on how quickly the orbit difference accumulates `p`-adic
divisibility.  The key chain is:

```
(A - 1) · (f^n(x) - x) = (A^n - 1) · ((A - 1)·x + B)   [integer ring]
⟹   vₚ(f^n(x) - x) ≥ vₚ(Aⁿ - 1) - vₚ(A - 1)
```

where `vₚ` is the `p`-adic valuation `padicValInt p` (where `p : ℕ` is prime).

Because `padicValInt : ℕ → ℤ → ℕ` takes a natural-number prime, all three
lemmas below use `p : ℕ` with `[Fact p.Prime]`, correcting the pseudo-code in
the blueprint which incorrectly typed `p : ℤ`.

**Annihilator difference over ℤ** (integer specialisation).

Over the integers, the difference `f^n(x) - x` satisfies the exact factorisation:
```
(A - 1) · (f^n(x) - x) = (A^n - 1) · ((A - 1)·x + B)
```
This isolates `A^n - 1`, the term governed by the Lifting-the-Exponent Lemma,
and is the arithmetic engine of the growth-rate bound.

The proof is a one-step ring computation after substituting
`affine_iterate_annihilated` (which holds for any `CommRing`, hence for `ℤ`).

#### Step 2: Multiplicative valuation split
-/

/--
**Additive valuation split** (logarithmic decomposition).

Because `padicValInt p` is additive on non-zero products:
```
vₚ(X · Y) = vₚ(X) + vₚ(Y)   when X, Y ≠ 0
```
the `affine_iterate_Z_diff` identity translates the product on each side into
an *additive* equation of valuations:
```
vₚ(A - 1) + vₚ(f^n(x) - x) = vₚ(A^n - 1) + vₚ((A-1)·x + B)
```

**Hypotheses:**
- `p : ℕ` with `[Fact p.Prime]` — the prime at which we measure divisibility.
- `h_lhs_ne` — the LHS product `(A - 1) · (f^n(x) - x) ≠ 0`, which forces all
  four factors to be non-zero (via `affine_iterate_Z_diff`).

#### Step 3: Valuation growth rate theorem
-/

/--
**p-adic valuation growth rate** (Lemma 1.2.2b).

The `p`-adic valuation of the orbit difference grows at least as fast as the
valuation of `A^n - 1` modulo the "baseline" valuation of `A - 1`:
```
vₚ(f^n(x) - x)  ≥  vₚ(A^n - 1) - vₚ(A - 1)
```
(all arithmetic in `ℕ`, so the RHS subtraction truncates at zero).

**Proof strategy:**
1. If `f^n(x) - x = 0`:  the identity `affine_iterate_Z_diff` forces `A^n - 1 = 0`
   (using `hA` and `hx`), so both sides vanish.
2. If `f^n(x) - x ≠ 0`:  apply `padic_val_Z_split` to obtain the exact additive
   equality `vₚ(A-1) + vₚ(diff) = vₚ(A^n-1) + vₚ(linear)`.  Since
   `vₚ(linear) ≥ 0` (it is a natural number), `vₚ(A-1) + vₚ(diff) ≥ vₚ(A^n-1)`,
   i.e. `vₚ(diff) ≥ vₚ(A^n-1) - vₚ(A-1)`.  This last step is discharged by
   `omega`.

**Note on types:** `padicValInt p : ℤ → ℕ` takes a *natural-number* prime
`p : ℕ` (with `[Fact p.Prime]`).  The `≥` is therefore `ℕ`-inequality, and
the right-hand subtraction is `ℕ`-truncating subtraction.
